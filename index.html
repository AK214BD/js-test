<!-- 3. What is the difference between `let, var, and const` variables?

Ans- -->
<p>
    3. Answer:-
    <br>
    var:
    Can be assigned and declared multiple times within its scope:
    Example:
    var x = 2.
    var x = 3. No error, but will print the last value (3)
    <br>
    <br>
    let:
    Can be reassigned within its block, but not redeclared:
    Example:
    let x = 20.
    let x = "bird". This will throw an error and print the first value only.
    <br>
    <br>
    const:

    Cannot be reassigned after its initial declaration:
    JavaScript
    const G = 9.8.
    G = 9.8. This will throw an error because const cannot be reassigned.
